Scrumlings:	    Yeonghwan Choi

Project Status:

* Bugs/blockers:
    * Andraey found the following bug in the database:
        CHANGED user_follower_id -> user_follow_id in  each function that has the user_follow_junction_table
    * Andraey and Dylan cannot get a URL for the API testing
    * Will and Jeryl seem to have some issues with importing existing files (e.g. custom exceptions). These issues
        are causing the unit testing to throw errors on his computer, and on Jeryl's computer, the program is stuck on
        on instantiating until it is stopped. Will is working on checking the imports and naming conventions.
* Will asked that we all maintain a record of the bugs so that we can merge them into a team bug record.
* We can all merge without needing a review, but we need to make sure to merge to the Python master, not to the main.
* We agreed to use their Acceptance Criteria to build the feature files, and catch any errors in the testing.
* We discussed that we will need to have a collaborative effort with the Java team to test the front end, as we will
    need their portion for the Alpha testing.
