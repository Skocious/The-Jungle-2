# General Standup
- Starting the morning with having everyone push to their respective branches if they did any work past cut off yesterday. It will then merge into their languages branch before having the Project Leads merge to main. It is then followed by having eveyone pull from the origin (main branch) so that everyone has the most up to date set of code possible.

- Discussed current status of tests, meeting deadlines, added new deadlines to the Test Plan to show current pace of work.


# Blockers
- The group as a whole was having some git pushing issues. 
    - The problem was solved by having everyone one by one push up (troubleshooting if necessary), and merging in a respective repo. Python for Python testers and Java for those working on Java. After which all branches, other than Main, Java and PythonMaster, were deleted, allowing for eveyone to then create new fresh branches with their next pushes. Security was set to not allow people to push or merge directly into main or on the respective side branches. The rule was put into place that you push to your personal branch and on github, merge your branch into your languages branch, only the Project leads, Matt and Zach are allowed to then do merges from a language branch into main. This allows for cleaner work flow, and smaller chance of having merge conflicts with the branches.
